# What am I looking at?

I, [Alex Caza](https://alexcaza.com), use a habit tracking app called [Way of Life](https://wayoflifeapp.com/). I love it. I've been using it on and off since 2017, and its simplicity and data ownership are 2 aspects I absolutely love about it.

However, those 2 key aspects are also its downfall for me.

I've recently wanted to start tracking my habits from multiple devices. Depending on the context my habit is in, I'll be focusing my attention on 1 of 3 devices. Way of Life unfortunately doesn't offer a good cloud sync option, forcing me to have to remember to go back to my phone to update it. This often means I'll do bulk updates and miss some notes I might've wanted to take in the moment.

So, like any programmer, I thought to myself: "I'll make my own Way of Life!"

This is part one in a multi-part process of building it. Part one being getting the data _out_ of Way of Life and _into_ another database.

I've decided to go with Notion for now. That way I don't have to deal with infrastructure It'll also fit nicely into my daily planning cycle if needed since I use Notion to [manage my life](https://alexcaza.com/personal/simplicity-in-life-management/).

My plan after finalizing this importer is to build a UI—most likely in ClojureScript—that I'll use across my iPhone, iPad and computer(s).

I'm _very new_ to Clojure. In fact, this is my first real project with it. I typically deal with Javascript in my day job, and have experience with Ruby, PHP and Python, but I don't have any "pure" language in my arsenal. This project is my attempt to learn one.

If you want to follow along, the other parts to this project will make-up various days in my 52 weeks challenge of 2021/2022. Which you can view here: [https://alexcaza.com/52-weeks](https://alexcaza.com/52-weeks)
